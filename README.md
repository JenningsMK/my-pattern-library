# The Reason

I have created a local server using [Express][1] to run our development environment at work. The aim of this repo is to 
improve what I have done & try different approaches.

## Current problems
* One of the problems I have with our current implementation is defining the data structure for a page. What I would like
to happen is the data is inhered from the component it is calling with the option to overwrite.
* My current implementation doesn't show you the output data & I believe this would be a nice to have.
